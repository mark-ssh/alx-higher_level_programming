<h1>Welcome to the Python world!</h1>

<h2>Author’s disclaimer</h2>
<p>The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
<br>If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
<br>You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
<br>Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.</p>

Enjoy!

<br>The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
<br>A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
<br>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
<br>Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
<br>All your files must be executable
<br>The length of your files will be tested using wc</p>

<h3>Shell Scripts</h3>
<br>Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

<br>No more than 5 functions per file
<br>In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
