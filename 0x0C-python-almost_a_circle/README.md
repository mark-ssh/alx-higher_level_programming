<ul><li>Import</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Private attribute</li>
<li>Getter/Setter</li>
<li>Class method</li>
<li>Static method</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Unittest</li>
<li>Read/Write file</li></ul>

<h3>You will also learn about:</h3>

<p>args and kwargs<br>
Serialization/Deserialization<br>
JSON</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:<br></p>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project<br>
How to serialize and deserialize a Class<br>
How to write and read a JSON file<br>
What is *args and how to use in <br>
What is **kwargs and how to use it<br>
How to handle named arguments in a function </p>

<h4>Copyright - Plagiarism</h4>
<p>You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.<br>
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<h5>Python Scripts</h5>
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start with test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
