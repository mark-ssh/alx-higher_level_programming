0x06. Python - Classes and Objects


Background Context
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a property
What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
How to bind attributes to object and classes
What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
How does Python find the attributes of an object or class

Tasks
0. My first square
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

You are not allowed to import any module

1. Square with size
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.
